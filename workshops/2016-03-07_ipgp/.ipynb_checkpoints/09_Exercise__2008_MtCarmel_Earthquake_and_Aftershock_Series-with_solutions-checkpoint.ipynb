    "*\"The largest-magnitude earthquake in the past 20 years struck near **Mt. Carmel in southeastern Illinois** on Friday morning, 18 April 2008 at 09:36:59 UTC (04:37 CDT). **The Mw 5.2 earthquake was felt over an area that spanned Chicago and Atlanta**, with about 40,000 reports submitted to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) “Did You Feel It?” system. There were at least six felt aftershocks greater than magnitude 3 and 20 aftershocks with magnitudes greater than 2 located by regional and national seismic networks. **Portable instrumentation was deployed** by researchers of the University of Memphis and Indiana University (the first portable station was installed at about 23:00 UTC on 18 April). The portable seismographs were deployed both to capture near-source, high-frequency ground motions for significant aftershocks and to better understand structure along the active fault. [...]\"*\n",
